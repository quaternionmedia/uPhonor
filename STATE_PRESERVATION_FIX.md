# Loop State Preservation Fix - FINAL SOLUTION

## Problem
When loading a configuration file, all memory loops were being reset to IDLE state instead of preserving their saved states (PLAYING/STOPPED). Additionally, loops marked as PLAYING in the configuration were not actually starting playback when loaded.

## Root Causes Identified

### Issue 1: Blanket Reset During JSON Parsing
The `parse_memory_loops_json()` function was resetting ALL loops to IDLE before parsing JSON data.

### Issue 2: Premature State Validation During JSON Parsing  
JSON parsing was validating states before audio files were loaded, causing `loop_ready` and `is_playing` to be incorrectly set to `false`.

### Issue 3: State Overwriting During Audio Loading (CRITICAL)
The `load_audio_file_into_loop()` function was **forcibly overwriting** the `current_state` to `LOOP_STATE_IDLE` after successfully loading audio files, destroying the states that were correctly parsed from JSON.

## Complete Solution

### 1. Selective Reset Logic (`config.c`)
```c
/* Only reset loops that don't have saved configuration data */
bool loops_to_restore[128] = {false};
// First pass: identify loops with saved data
// Second pass: only reset loops without saved data
```

### 2. Deferred State Validation (`config.c`) 
```c
/* Store intended values from JSON without premature validation */
loop->loop_ready = cJSON_IsTrue(item);  // No validation against recorded_frames yet
loop->is_playing = cJSON_IsTrue(item);  // No validation against loop_ready yet
```

### 3. Preserve States During Audio Loading (`config_file_loader.c`)
```c
/* CRITICAL FIX: Don't overwrite current_state during audio loading */
/* Update loop state - preserve current_state that was set during JSON parsing */
loop->recorded_frames = (uint32_t)frames_read;
loop->playback_position = 0;
loop->loop_ready = true;
loop->recording_to_memory = false;
/* REMOVED: loop->current_state = LOOP_STATE_IDLE; */
```

### 4. Post-Loading State Restoration and Validation (`config_file_loader.c`)
```c
/* Validate and restore loop states after audio loading */
if (loop->recorded_frames > 0) {
    loop->loop_ready = true;
    
    /* Set is_playing flag based on current_state */
    if (loop->current_state == LOOP_STATE_PLAYING) {
        loop->is_playing = true;
        printf("Loop %d: Restored to PLAYING state\n", i);
    }
    else if (loop->current_state == LOOP_STATE_STOPPED) {
        loop->is_playing = false;
        printf("Loop %d: Restored to STOPPED state\n", i);
    }
    // ... handle other states
}
```

## Loading Sequence (Fixed)
1. **JSON Parsing**: Store intended states from JSON without validation
2. **Audio Loading**: Load audio data while **preserving** states from JSON
3. **State Validation**: Ensure consistency between flags and available audio data
4. **Result**: Loops preserve their saved states AND start playing if marked as PLAYING

## Behavior After Complete Fix
- ✅ **State Preservation**: Loops with saved states (PLAYING, STOPPED) preserve their states when loading configurations  
- ✅ **Automatic Playback**: Loops marked as PLAYING in the config actually start playing after loading
- ✅ **Audio Loading**: Audio files load correctly into loop memory
- ✅ **State Consistency**: `current_state`, `is_playing`, `loop_ready` flags are consistent
- ✅ **Failed Audio Handling**: Loops with missing audio files are safely reset to IDLE
- ✅ **IDLE Filtering**: Saves continue to exclude IDLE loops
- ✅ **MIDI Runtime Save**: CC 81 functionality works correctly

## Testing Workflow
1. Create loops and set them to PLAYING or STOPPED states
2. Save the configuration (manually or via MIDI CC 81)
3. Exit and restart the application  
4. Load the configuration
5. **Verify**: PLAYING loops automatically start playing, STOPPED loops remain stopped
6. Save again immediately and check that states are preserved (not all IDLE)

## Files Modified
- `config.c`: Updated `parse_memory_loops_json()` with selective reset and deferred validation
- `config_file_loader.c`: 
  - **CRITICAL**: Removed state overwriting in `load_audio_file_into_loop()`
  - Added comprehensive state restoration in `config_load_audio_files()`

## Key Insight
The critical breakthrough was realizing that the audio loading function was destroying the carefully preserved states from JSON parsing. This explains why all previous attempts at fixing the JSON parsing logic alone were insufficient - the states were being correctly parsed and then immediately overwritten during audio loading.
